HHVM 4.4 is released! This release will be supported for 6 weeks, and HHVM
4.1+ remain supported.

This weeks' work was mostly performance improvements, bug fixes, and work on
future features.

# Highlights

- Improved error messages for variadic functions that are not passed enough
  arguments
- Fix support for `hh_server --config`, allowing overriding hhconfig options
  via the CLI

# Breaking Changes

- `__callStatic()` is no longer supported; if manual analysis is not practical
  for migration, we recommend adding logging wrappers while using a previous
  version of HHVM.
- `ext_session` and the `$_SESSION` superglobal have been removed

# Other Notes

- The `hhvm.jit_profile_interp_requests` option has been removed, as it no
  has any effect
