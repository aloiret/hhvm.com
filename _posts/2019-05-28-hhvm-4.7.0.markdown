HHVM 4.7 is released! This release will be supported for 6 weeks, and HHVM 4.2+
remain supported. This release marks the end of support for HHVM 4.1.

# Highlights

- the typechecker has a new type inference engine; this leads to errors being
  raised in more cases due to better type information. If code is intentionally
  unsafe, this can also lead to errors moving, so suppression comments may need
  to be moved.
- added `\HH\global_keys()` and `\HH\global_key_exists()`; in these can be used
  in combination with `\HH\global_get()` and `\HH\global_set()` as a replacement
  for `$_GLOBALS`; these are currently undocumented, and we aim to resolve this
  shortly.
- await-as-an-expression is now supported in XHP expressions
- improved handling of EINTR in hhvm-hackc and hh\_client-hh\_server communication
- added HHI definition for various request tracing functions in the
  `HH\rqtrace` namespace

# Breaking Changes

- the typechecker's new inference can lead to more errors, or errors in
  different locations.
- Corrected capitalization of `DOMDocument::createAttributeNS`
- `declare()` and `enddeclare()` are no longer supported
- it is no longer possible to reference type `Ta::Tb` if `Ta` is nullable.
- `empty()` is no longer supported; `hhast-migrate --empty-expression` can be
  used to replace `empty($expr)` with `(!$expr ?? false)` in HHAST 4.6.1 under
  HHVM 4.6
