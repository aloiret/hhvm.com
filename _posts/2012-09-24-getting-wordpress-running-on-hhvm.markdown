    Very nice post, but please tell, where i can find documentation on HHVM for future reading?
    First of all, is it somewhere specification about hhvm.hdf structure?
    And also it's very interesting to read about debugging features.

    At the moment, all the real documentation is in git under the doc&#47; directory, but it's a bit dry and hard to read casually.

    I plan to publish a version of the PHP manual with HipHop details merged in where appropriate (particularly under configuration and runtime variances).

    In the case of the first attempt, can you define: "Nothing happened"?  Nothing should appear to happen on the command line since you're starting up the server and it's sitting around waiting for web requests.  Does `ps ax` show it running? Do you get anything when trying to browse to that server with your webbrowser?

    On the second one, you're mixing verbs.  You've selected `--mode server` which is going to make HHVM try to load up a whole directory full of files (though you haven't specified which directory).  What you have done is a pass a single file name with is more appropriate to just running as a command-line script (without passing the --mode server flag).

    Lastly what version of PHP is HHPHP compatible with?

    Well, I tried to get it running with Drupal, but somehow it seems to be lacking a lot of verbose output to help you understand where it goes wrong

    I documented the whole process below and used vagrant to made sure that my machine was not corrupt.
    http:&#47;&#47;nickveenhof.be&#47;blog&#47;getting-drupal-7-almost-running-hhvm

    The server started in daemon mode, and then shows a message "Not Found". It also does not report anything in the error.log (while it does have write access)

    I'd appreciate if there were more runtime debug modes? Perhaps it could be ran in --mode server and show the errors in the terminal? Perhaps I'm not seeing the obvious?

    of the stack.  db-layer speed-ups (which is the first thing anyone should address)
    are out of scope, but I'm sure you'll find many posts on technique involving memcached,
    judicious use of indexes, etc... for that.

    Our (unpublished) stats say that facebook.com would require aproximately 6x as many front-end machines if we were using stock PHP. ((Note that the FB codebase is tightly tuned to HipHop))  I've also got some numbers showing hiphop&#47;repojit performing at about 4:1 for more generic codebases like Wordpress.

    Beyond speed, there's the differences in what we're doing with the language syntax itself.  HipHop had generators long before PHP (php.net just added these for 5.5), and we've got a strict typing implementation on its way down the pipe which should improve development a bit.

    As replied on your blog (and twitter), I didn't see the same issues as you, primarily because I ran into other problems at an earlier stage with the lack of support for custom stream wrappers.

    Short version: Yes, drupal and hiphop aren't friends at this point.  We'll have to do some work there.

  content: Np. Prob not the right place to ask this question is - but wondering if
    you could touch on the following topics in future blog posts  1) how does FB store
    session data across nodes? You back your sessions with memcache?  2) Also wondering
    how you roll out code updates and "warm" up the cache&#47;clear old cache without
    disrupting incoming requests.  With apc+fpm I just clear the opcode and requests
    in flight are not impacted, while new requests get the code updates. I'm still
    not clear on how this works in the wild with HHVM+JIT. Do you just run '&#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;hhvm-analyze'
    , copy the &#47;tmp&#47;hphp_XXXXX&#47;hhvm.hhbc.sq3 to 'Repo {  Central {    Path'
    and kill&#47;start the &#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;hhvm?

    I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 and compiled HHVM using the guide at the wiki.
    I tend to use the laravel framework for my webpages; however, functons such as function_exists()&#47;class_exists() isn't supported.

    I saw that they were supported using the --hphp -v "AllVolatile=true" option. But that requires me to use "old" hphp, right? Which isn't going to be supported after mid 2013?

    Is there by any chanse, possible, to use those functions, using HHVM?

    Well, HipHop *is* an implementation of PHP, so no: You don't need PHP installed.

    It's also got it's own web server built in.  Notice how the "Configuring" section talks about port numbers and virtual hosts and logging?  So no to that as well.  You *can* put Apache in front of HipHop if you need access to some of the additional feature Apache has, but in that case Apache would just be proxying to HipHop's web server.

    Considering trying to run hhvm with nginx as detailed here https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;facebook&#47;hiphop-php&#47;wiki&#47;Using-nginx-as-Front-Server-to-HipHop
    to see if I can get something to give.\n\nor is there a way to do this solely
    with hiphop?"

    not working for me...\nI just created a new AWS EC2 Ubuntu 12.04 LTS instance
    and installed a prebuilt package of Hiphop VM (v2.0.2). I applied the Object declaration
    fix and forgo the other Wordpress tweaks as they appear to be striked out. \nHowever
    Wordpress (brand new 3.4.2 installtion) still won't run. I can visit separate
    pages via MY_DOMAIN&#47;wordpress&#47;php-page.php (must have the .php suffix,
    otherwise chrome will just display \"Not found\"), but Wordpress as a whole just
    doesn't run. The error that I see are either \"web page not available\" or simply
    \"not found\".\nI tried to run the server with and w&#47;out the config or user
    settings to the same results."

    Wordpress works by hitting [WordpressDirectory]&#47;index.php which the loads everything else. Depending on the referring url, Wordpress will spit up various pages.
    If you default hiphop in the server block of the configuration with
    DefaultDocument = index.php

    then you should be good to run. You will not be able to use permalinks, but leaving posts in their ?p=number form should let you spit up pages&#47;posts.

    I have not found much documentation on making this working with fully formed slugs, but I'm looking into it. Ideally I want to be running a multisite wordpress from hiphop.

    Can someone shed some light on this?

    I tried to get around this problem with an nginx front end but could not get it to work using proxy_pass, despite it working fine for php5-fpm using fcgi_pass. Very frustrating.

    I'd switch to hphp and ditch php5-fpm+xcache+opcache tomorrow for Wordpress if it could do clean URLs.

This article aims to walk through the installation process for getting WordPress running on HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine).

<!--truncate-->

## Installing HHVM

For the sake of this case-study, I used Ubuntu "Precise" 12.04 as my linux distribution since I'd be able to [install from a simple binary package](https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/Prebuilt-packages-on-ubuntu-12.04).  Instructions are currently available for [building for Ubuntu 12.04](https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/Building-and-installing-HHVM-on-Ubuntu-12.04) yourself, or [building for CentOS 6.3](https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/Building-and-installing-HHVM-on-CentOS-6.3).  Other distros will probably work with some effort, and you're encouraged to try.

## Unpacking Wordpress

Head to [wordpress.org/download](http://wordpress.org/download) to grab the [latest tar.gz](http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz) version of Wordpress and unpack it in a suitable location.  For the purposes of this post, I'll be using _/var/www/wp/_


     $ cd /var/www
     $ wget 'http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz'
     $ tar -zxf latest.tar.gz
     $ mv wordpress wp

##  Making a few... tweaks

**Update:** As of WordPress 3.9, and HHVM 2.0 the following changes aren't necessary as WP have updated their codebase to play nice with HHVM, and HHVM has updated itself to support more PHP stuff.  Isnt' Open Source awesome? :)

<del>Wordpress doesn't quite work "right out of the box" with HHVM because a few of HipHop's behaviors differ from the PHP it was built for.</del>

<del>First, case-insensitive constants are simply not supported by HipHop.  They're a bit silly, rarely used, and are more expensive (computationally) than they're worth.  Fortunately, wordpress only uses this feature in one place (to maintain BC with older plugins), and we can work around it by defining the most common variants.</del>

<del>Open up _wp-includes/wp-db.php_ and look for the line which defines the _'OBJECT'_ constant (line 20 in my version).  We'll want to take off the third parameter saying to declare it case-insensitively, and add in the lower-case and drop-case versions as alternates. This should be enough to cover 99% of plugins out there.</del>

<pre>
<del>
define('OBJECT', 'OBJECT');
define('Object', 'OBJECT');
define('object', 'OBJECT');
</del>
</pre>


<del>The rest of the changes are actually just temporary work-arounds for fixes which will be in HipHop in the next week or so.  **I'll update this post as those fixes reach github.**</del>

<del>As of this writing,_ ini_get('post_max_size')_ will return an empty string, and _ini_get('upload_max_filesize')_ will return a size in megabytes, but without the '_M_' suffix, so it is interpreted as bytes.  Fixes for both of these are currently pending, so just set them both manually for now.</del>

<pre>
<del>
// wp-admin/includes/template.php in wp_max_upload_size()

#$u_bytes = wp_convert_hr_to_bytes(ini_get('upload_max_filesize'));
#$p_bytes = wp_convert_hr_to_bytes(ini_get('post_max_size'));
$u_bytes =
$p_bytes = 100 << 20; // 100MB, or whatever you'll be setting
</del>
</pre>


**Update**: Both _post_max_size_ and _upload_max_filesize_ have been updated to return sane values and these changes are no longer required.

<del>_magic_quotes_runtime_ is (happily) not supported by HipHop.  _get_magic_quotes_runtime_() probably should have just quietly returned false, but for whatever reason it was implemented as throwing a "not implemented" exception.  A fix for this is currently pending, so hard-code a zero (false) for now.</del>

<pre>
<del>
// wp-admin/includes/class-pclzip.php in privDisableMagicQuotes()
#$this->magic_quotes_status = @get_magic_quotes_runtime();
$this->magic_quotes_status = 0;

// wp-includes/class-phpmailer.php in EncodeFile()
#$magic_quotes = get_magic_quotes_runtime();
$magic_quotes = 0;
</del>
</pre>

**Update**: _get_magic_quotes_runtime()_ has been updated to always return 0 (false) rather than throwing an exception.  This tweak no longer needs to be made.

## Create a config file

The syntax for HipHop's web server is pretty extensive, but the following placed in _/etc/hhvm.hdf_ should be enough to get you going.  Refer to [options.compiled](https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/blob/master/doc/options.compiled) for other settings.


    // /etc/hhvm.hdf

    Server {
      Port = 80
      SourceRoot = /var/www/
    }

    Eval {
      Jit = true
    }
    Log {
      Level = Error
      UseLogFile = true
      File = /var/log/hhvm/error.log
      Access {
        * {
          File = /var/log/hhvm/access.log
          Format = %h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b
        }
      }
    }

    VirtualHost {
      * {
        Pattern = .*
        RewriteRules {
          dirindex {
            pattern = ^/(.*)/$
            to = $1/index.php
            qsa = true
          }
        }
      }
    }

    StaticFile {
      FilesMatch {
        * {
          pattern = .*.(dll|exe)
          headers {
            * = Content-Disposition: attachment
          }
        }
      }
      Extensions {
        css = text/css
        gif = image/gif
        html = text/html
        jpe = image/jpeg
        jpeg = image/jpeg
        jpg = image/jpeg
        png = image/png
        tif = image/tiff
        tiff = image/tiff
        txt = text/plain
      }
    }


You may wish to add other directives and static file extensions, but this will get you started.  The RewriteRule is to accomodate the fact that HipHop does not (currently) support a DirectoryIndex style directive.  While this feature is currently in development, we can get by with a general case rewrite rule.


## Start the webserver

Pretty straight-forward, just press go:


    sudo /usr/bin/hhvm --mode daemon --user web --config /etc/hhvm.hdf


Assuming of course you have a user designated for your web server to run as named 'web'.  Rename this one as needed.

## Wordpress setup


From here, setup follows the normal "[Famous 5 Minute Installation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress)".  If you run into any trouble, check that you updated system files as described above, look into your error.log, or leave a comment here or on our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/HipHop-for-PHP/282425744325).
