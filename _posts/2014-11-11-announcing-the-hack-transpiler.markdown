We're proud to announce the first experimental release of the Hack Transpiler, a tool which allows projects that have converted from PHP to Hack to still make releases that target the PHP language. [You can read the full announcement at code.facebook.com](https://code.facebook.com/posts/398235553660954/announcing-the-hack-transpiler/), or [take a look at the documentation for the tool](http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/install.hack.h2tp.php). It's available in any [nightly package](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt%20Packages%20for%20HHVM) dated today or later. It's still experimental, so try it out and let us know how it goes!
