HHVM 3.30.3 is released; this release contains several bugfixes:
- Fix support for single-core computers of virtual machines
- Fix an issue in hhbbc that could lead to a segfault when building for
  repo-authoritative mode
- Fix support for `#` comments in IDE integration - previously these would be
  rendered as markdown headings.
