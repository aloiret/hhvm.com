HHVM 3.30.1 and 3.27.5 are released; these releases address CVE-2018-6340, a
stack read overflow in Memcache::getExtendedStats(). Exploiting this requires
control over memcached server hostnames and/or ports.

Additionally:
- 3.27.5 includes a fix for type coverage IDE support
- our Mac binaries have been rebuilt to require sandybridge (model year 2011 or
  later). This provides a 10x performance improvement on some common workloads.
