Noteworthy changes include:

* PHP7 Scalar Typehints behavior corrected ([the issue](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/7198)).
  * HHVM 3.20.2 and later works with Composer while running on HHVM in PHP7 mode, [Tests have also been added](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/af3471b40468023035d4308f7f73de80bdf03927).
* LibSodium extension added:  This is an extension that will be 
  added in PHP7.2 (not built for Debian7).  Since it is not released in PHP yet
  it is experimental as the spec may change.
* Timelimit for time spent JITing per request.  See the `hhvm.jit_max_request_translation_time` setting.
* Reusable TC now runs on a worker thread, cleaning up translations without
  tieing up request threads, or the request treadmill.
* Performance improvements
* Bug fixes
