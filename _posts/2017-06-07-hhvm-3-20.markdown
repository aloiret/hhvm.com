HHVM 3.20 is released!  This release improves compatibility with PHP7, and
adds a couple new features.  Packages have been published in the usual places;
see the
[installation
instructions](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/introduction) for more
information.

Noteworthy changes include:

* PHP7 Scalar Typehints behavior corrected ([the issue](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/7198)).
  * A patch for 3.20 is coming that fixes Composer while running on HHVM in PHP7 mode.
* LibSodium extension added:  This is an extension that will be 
  added in PHP7.2 (not built for Debian7).  Since it is not released in PHP yet
  it is experimental as the spec may change.
* Timelimit for time spent JITing per request.  See the `hhvm.jit_max_request_translation_time` setting.
* Reusable TC now runs on a worker thread, cleaning up translations without
  tieing up request threads, or the request treadmill.
* Performance improvements
* Bug fixes
