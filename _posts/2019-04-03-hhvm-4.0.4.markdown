These releases address CVE-2019-3561; it was previously possible to read
unintended memory locations if invalid offsets were passed to `strrpos`.

Additionally, 3.30.5 makes it possible to configure `hackfmt` behavior via
`.hhconfig`, such as:
- `hackfmt.add_trailing_commas`
- `hackfmt.indent_width`
- `hackfmt.tabs`
- `hackfmt.line_width`

These options were already supported in 4.0.
