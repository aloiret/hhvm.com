    Hey,

    thanks for this! Is FreeBSD support planned for 2.2.0 ?
    In the github wiki there is a page for this: https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;facebook&#47;hhvm&#47;wiki&#47;Building-and-installing-HHVM-on-FreeBSD-from-ports
    But sadly only the 2.1.0 port is available.

    Thx for feedback!

    Thanks for your hard work, guys!

    I don't know about the plans, but I see a real possibility of this replacing the PHPimplementation we have today, if you call it that since there's no spec.

    I would most definitely move all my productions sites to the HHVM if that happened. Only thing I would like to have is better integrated testing tools or I don't know, its just too boring to test on PHP today, compared to ruby and python.

    Yes, mysqli is on the near-term roadmap. A few months is my guess. I would love a pull request for it if you need it faster :)

    As for CentOS 6 I tried to follow these instructions https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;facebook&#47;hhvm&#47;wiki&#47;Building-and-installing-HHVM-on-CentOS-6.4 and libmemcached wouldn't even compile so I didn't continue. Can you update the instructions and I can package it next time then?

    For async, is there a PHP equivalent? Cursory googling just shows some frameworks that probably work already. Please try them and report back.

    I tried
    Route::get('users',function(){

    });

    Anyone who can shed some light?

    Sean Cannella on GitHub:
    That is a mistake in the changelog. gettext is being run via the experimental Zend compatibility layer that can run PHP extensions built for Zend as-is which is still, as the name suggests, experimental.

    Sorry, this is still being worked on and isn't available for use. Changelog updated.

    2.Does HHVM works with PDO ?

    As soon as I'm confident it works. My metric is "take an existing extension, try to compile it, see how much has to change". If the amount of unimplemented functions is too high, I have to keep iterating.

    Right now, I'm trying to see if I can get our headers to have C linkage so you don't even have to do the C -> C++ conversion.

    If you want to try it out now, feel free to compile your code against the headers I have there and see what doens't link.

We released a new version of HHVM today. A big change is that we are now packaging for many of the popular distros.


<!--truncate-->

  * [Ubuntu 12.04](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Ubuntu-12.04) / [13.04](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Ubuntu-13.04) / [13.10](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Ubuntu-13.10)


  * [Mint 15](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Mint-15)


  * [Debian 7](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Debian-7)


  * [Fedora 19](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Fedora-19)


If your favorite one isn't there, leave a comment and we'll try to add it. Or if you want to become the packager for that distro, great! Bundle it up and then update the [wiki](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki#installing-pre-built-packages-for-hhvm).

The new packages have their files moved around a bit. Everything is now named **hhvm** in there, so if your scripts relied on anything named **hiphop-php** please update them.

This release was a 17% CPU reduction for running facebook.com compared to HHVM 2.1.0. It also supports many [more frameworks out of the box](http://www.hhvm.com/blog/875/wow-hhvm-is-fast-too-bad-it-doesnt-run-my-code) like Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, and many more.
