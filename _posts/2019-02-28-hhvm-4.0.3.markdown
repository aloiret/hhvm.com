This release is fixes some IDE features in `.hack` files, especially in
`.hack` files which contain the string `<?hh` such as code generators.

Unfortunately, fixing this required breaking the same IDE features for PHP
files that contain leading markup (content before the `<?`) - for example:

```
<html>
<head>
<title><?php echo htmlspecialchars(get_page_title(); ?></title>
</head>
...
</html>
```

Files that start with `<?` or a shebang line (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env hhvm`)
immediately followed by `<?` at the start of the second line are not affected.

Additionally, our MacOS packages have been rebuilt to workaround some
incompatibilities with recent versinos of dependencies, and to require
Sandybridge-or-newer processors. Requiring Sandybridge provides a 19x speedup
over Homebrew's defaults for some real-world workloads.
