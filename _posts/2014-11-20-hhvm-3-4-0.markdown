    Hi Rob,

    Can you give us some more specifics about what type of memory leaks you are seeing? We have been working hard on memory lately and want to know
    places we possibly missed. File an issue at https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;facebook&#47;hhvm&#47;issues

    Did you `apt-get hhvm` to upgrade? I would think you could `apt-get install hhvm=3.3` (or something like that), although I haven't tried that before. You might want to go on #hhvm on Freenode IRC to see if other users have tried a downgrade. I normally build from master.
